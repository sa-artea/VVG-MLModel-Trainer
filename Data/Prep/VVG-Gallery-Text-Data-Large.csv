The painting had to depict the harsh reality of country life, so he gave the peasants coarse faces and bony, working hands. He wanted to show in this way that they have tilled the earth themselves with these hands they are putting in the dish ... that they have thus honestly earned their food. He painted the five figures in earth colours something like the colour of a really dusty potato, unpeeled of course. The message of the painting was more important to Van Gogh than correct anatomy or technical perfection. He was very pleased with the result: yet his painting drew considerable criticism because its colours were so dark and the figures full of mistakes.

The thing struck me greatly; those two cottages, half decayed under one and the same thatched roof, reminded me of a couple of worn-out old folk who make up just one single being and whom one sees supporting each other, he wrote.

Over the years, however, his style of painting had changed significantly: by that time, he used bright colours and loose brushwork.","http://www.vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let506/letter.html","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","Vincent van Gogh","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Date=1885","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Place=Nuenen","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Artist=Vincent van Gogh","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost",,

Van Gogh used a fine pen and brown ink to fill in the legs and antennae, added a few little lines to the wings and drew an extra outline around them. He accentuated the dark parts of the moth by thickly applying brown ink. He used the same ink with a pen and brush to draw a frame around the image.

He produced a series of paintings and drawings he called _Reminiscences of the North_. And while my illness was at its worst, I still painted, among other things a reminiscence of Brabant, cottages with mossy roofs and beech hedges, [he wrote](http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let864/letter.html) in April 1890.. . This drawing shows Dutch-style houses with low hedges in the hilly landscape around Saint-Remy. Van Gogh usually took reality as the starting point for his art, but here he merges that reality with memories of his native region. He placed agricultural labourers a frequent theme of his in the Netherlands prominently in the foreground. He was not so impressed, however, by southern French peasants. In our country one sees men, women, children, animals at work everywhere and at all times of the year, and here not a third of that, and in addition theyre not the honest workers of the north.

The high barn and the lower building were at the edge of this area. Beyond them lay the factories on the outskirts of Paris. There are small holes in the corners of the paper. Van Gogh probably made them when he pinned up the sheet. In the late summer of 1887, Van Gogh painted sunflowers for the first time. In Arles (FR) he painted large bouquets of sunflowers in a vase; these paintings later made him world-famous.","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","Vincent van Gogh","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Artist=Vincent van Gogh","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Date=1887","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Place=Paris","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Genre=cityscape","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Type=drawing","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost",,

All the same, he rendered the tassel hyacinths in considerable detail, opting for the Japanese manner and drawing the little flower buds close-up, against a blank background. He went over the pencil lines in brown ink using a fine brush. Van Gogh painted Tassel Hyacinths shortly after entering the psychiatric institution at Saint-Remy.
