It was part of a whole series of such studies. This standing torso of Venus must have been his favourite model: he made no fewer than five studies of it. Two of them are now in the collection of the Van Gogh Museum. Van Gogh painted the background deep blue.

He was looking specifically for country people, both men and women, who had coarse, flat faces with low foreheads and thick lips. He wanted to paint 50 of them as what he called study heads.

Peasant women in Brabant really did wear white headdresses in those days. These intrigued Van Gogh because of the contrast with their faces, which remained partly in shadow. The heads of these women here with the white caps its difficult but its so eternally beautiful, he wrote.

He needed models so that he could practise portrait painting. Only ladies of easy virtue could be persuaded to pose for a painter they had never met before.

Its almost as if he were drawing in thin paint. You can also see the contrasting colours: green, orange-red and purple. But if you look from a distance (or through your eyelashes), all those colours melt into a warm grey.

"s0201V1962","Torso of Venus Vincent van Gogh (1853 - 1890), Paris, June 1886 oil on cardboard, 35.3 cm x 27.2 cm This painting is one of a series of studies of plaster models. Van Gogh owned around eleven such models of sculptures from classical antiquity or the Renaissance. Among them was this standing torso of Venus, which he painted a number of times. Among other things, Van Gogh was experimenting with the effect of different kinds of background. Here, he has placed his brushstrokes at right-angles to each other, so that they look rather like wickerwork. He would use this technique more than once in his later work.

"s0202V1962","Horse Vincent van Gogh (1853 - 1890), Paris, June 1886 oil on cardboard, 33.1 cm x 40.9 cm For this study in oils, Van Gogh used a small plaster model of a horse. He was then studying at the Antwerp art academy. There drawing was taught with the help of models like these, but painting had to be practiced at home. He painted this little horse on cardboard instead of canvas, because that was much cheaper. The model was preserved by the Van Gogh family through the years.
