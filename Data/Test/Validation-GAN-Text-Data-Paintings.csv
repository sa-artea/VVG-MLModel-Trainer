1,How Beastly the Bourgeois Is,D. H.  Lawrence,"How beastly the bourgeois is
especially the male of the species-

Presentable,  eminently presentable-
shall I make you a present of him?

Isnt he handsome?  Isnt he healthy?  Isnt he a fine specimen?
Doesnt he look the fresh clean Englishman,  outside?
Isnt it Gods own image? tramping his thirty miles a day
after partridges,  or a little rubber ball?
wouldnt you like to be like that,  well off,  and quite the thing

Oh,  but wait!
Let him meet a new emotion,  let him be faced with another mans need, 
let him come home to a bit of moral difficulty,  let life face him with a new 
     demand on his understanding
and then watch him go soggy,  like a wet meringue. 
Watch him turn into a mess,  either a fool or a bully. 
Just watch the display of him,  confronted with a new demand on his intelligence, 
a new life-demand. 

How beastly the bourgeois is
especially the male of the species--

Nicely groomed,  like a mushroom
standing there so sleek and erect and eyeable--
and like a fungus,  living on the remains of a bygone life
sucking his life out of the dead leaves of greater life than his own. 

And even so,  hes stale,  hes been there too long. 
Touch him,  and youll find hes all gone inside
just like an old mushroom,  all wormy inside,  and hollow
under a smooth skin and an upright appearance. 

Full of seething,  wormy,  hollow feelings
rather nasty--
How beastly the bourgeois is!

Standing in their thousands,  these appearances,  in damp England
what a pity they cant all be kicked over
like sickening toadstools,  and left to melt back,  swiftly
into the soil of England. "
2,CXXIX,William Shakespeare,"The expense of spirit in a waste of shame
Is lust in action:  and till action,  lust
Is perjured,  murderous,  bloody,  full of blame, 
Savage,  extreme,  rude,  cruel,  not to trust;
Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight;
Past reason hunted; and no sooner had, 
Past reason hated,  as a swallowed bait, 
On purpose laid to make the taker mad. 
Mad in pursuit and in possession so;
Had,  having,  and in quest to have extreme;
A bliss in proof,  and proved,  a very woe;
Before,  a joy proposed; behind a dream. 
All this the world well knows; yet none knows well
To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell. "
3,Joy to have merited the Pain,Emily Dickinson,"Joy to have merited the Pain—
To merit the Release—
Joy to have perished every step—
To Compass Paradise—

Pardon—to look upon thy face—
With these old fashioned Eyes—
Better than new—could be—for that—
Though bought in Paradise—

Because they looked on thee before—
And thou hast looked on them—
Prove Me—My Hazel Witnesses
The features are the same—

So fleet thou wert,  when present—
So infinite—when gone—
An Orients Apparition—
Remanded of the Morn—

The Height I recollect—
Twas even with the Hills—
The Depth upon my Soul was notched—
As Floods—on Whites of Wheels—

To Haunt—till Time have dropped
His last Decade away, 
And Haunting actualize—to last
At least—Eternity—"
4,Dream Within a Dream,Edgar Allan Poe,"Take this kiss upon the brow!
And,  in parting from you now, 
Thus much let me avow-
You are not wrong,  who deem
That my days have been a dream;
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night,  or in a day, 
In a vision,  or in none, 
Is it therefore the less gone?
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream. 

I stand amid the roar
Of a surf-tormented shore, 
And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand-
How few! yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep, 
While I weep- while I weep!
O God! can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp?
O God! can I not save
One from the pitiless wave?
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream?"
5,A Woman Speaks,Audre Lorde,"Moon marked and touched by sun   
my magic is unwritten
but when the sea turns back
it will leave my shape behind.    
I seek no favor
untouched by blood
unrelenting as the curse of love   
permanent as my errors
or my pride
I do not mix
love with pity
nor hate with scorn
and if you would know me
look into the entrails of Uranus   
where the restless oceans pound. 

I do not dwell
within my birth nor my divinities   
who am ageless and half-grown   
and still seeking
my sisters
witches in Dahomey
wear me inside their coiled cloths   
as our mother did
mourning. 

I have been woman
for a long time
beware my smile
I am treacherous with old magic   
and the noons new fury
with all your wide futures   
promised
I am
woman
and not white. "
6,Apprehensions,Sylvia Plath,"There is this white wall,  above which the sky creates itself-
Infinite,  green,  utterly untouchable. 
Angels swim in it,  and the stars,  in indifference also. 
They are my medium. 
The sun dissolves on this wall,  bleeding its lights. 

A grey wall now,  clawed and bloody. 
Is there no way out of the mind?
Steps at my back spiral into a well. 
There are no trees or birds in this world, 
There is only sourness. 

This red wall winces continually: 
A red fist,  opening and closing, 
Two grey,  papery bags-
This is what i am made of,  this,  and a terror
Of being wheeled off under crosses and rain of pieties. 

On a black wall,  unidentifiable birds
Swivel their heads and cry. 
There is no talk of immorality among these!
Cold blanks approach us: 

They move in a hurry. "
7,Ulster 1912,Rudyard Kipling,"Their webs shall not become garments,  neither shall they cover themselves with their works:  their works are works of iniquity and the act of violence is in their hands.  
Isaiah LIX.  6. 


The dark eleventh hour
Draws on and sees us sold
To every evil power
We fought against of old -
Rebellion,  rapine,  hate, 
Oppression,  wrong and greed
Are loosed to rule our fate
By Englands art and deed. 

The faith in which we stand, 
The laws we made and guard, 
Our honour,  lives,  and land
Are given for reward
To murder done by night
To treason taught by day, 
To folly,  sloth,  and spite, 
And we are thrust away. 

The blood our fathers spilt, 
Our love,  our toils,  our pains
Are counted us for guilt
And only bind our chains -
Before an Empires eyes
The traitor claims his price. 
What need of further lies?
We are the sacrifice. 

We know the war prepared
On ever peaceful home
We know the hells prepared
For such as serve not Rome
The terror,  threats,  and bread
In market,  hearth,  and field -
We know,  when all is said, 
We perish if we yield. 

Believe we dare not boast, 
Believe we dare not fear: 
We stand to pay the cost
In all that men hold dear. 
What answer from the North?
One Law,  One Land,  One Throne!
If England drives us forth
We shall not fall alone. "
8,Mongol epic poem,Unknown,"There is a khans daughter
Who steps on in a SWINGING manner
And has the marks of twenty tigers, 
Who steps on in a GRACEFUL manner
And has the marks of thirty manner
Who steps on in an ELEGANT manner
And has the marks of forty tigers, 
Who steps on in a DELICATE manner
And has the marks of fifty tigers. "

10,The Suicide,Joyce Carol Oates,"didnt thank
didnt wave goodbye
didnt flutter the air with kisses
a mound of gifts unwrapped
bed unmade
no appetite

always elsewhere

though it was raining elsewhere
though strangers peopled the streets
though we at home slaved and
baked and wept and
hung ornaments
and perfumed the dark
did he marvel
did he thank

was he grateful        did he know
was he human
was he there

always elsewhere: 
didnt thank
didnt kiss
toothbrush stiffened with unuse
puppy whining in the hall
car battery dead
sweaters unraveled

was that human?

Went where?"
11,When Stretchd on Ones Bed,Jane Austen,"When stretchd on ones bed
With a fierce-throbbing head, 
Which precludes alike thought or repose, 
How little one cares
For the grandest affairs
That may busy the world as it goes!

How little one feels
For the waltzes and reels
Of our Dance-loving friends at a Ball!
How slight ones concern
To conjecture or learn
What their flounces or hearts may befall. 

How little one minds
If a company dines
On the best that the Season affords!
How short is ones muse
Oer the Sauces and Stews, 
Or the Guests,  be they Beggars or Lords. 

How little the Bells, 
Ring they Peels,  toll they Knells, 
Can attract our attention or Ears!
The Bride may be married, 
The Corse may be carried
And touch nor our hopes nor our fears. 

Our own bodily pains
Evry faculty chains;
We can feel on no subject besides. 
Tis in health and in ease
We the power must seize
For our friends and our souls to provide. "
12,Humming Bird,D. H.  Lawrence,"I can imagine,  in some otherworld
Primeval-dumb,  far back
In that most awful stillness,  that only gasped and hummed, 
Humming-birds raced down the avenues. 
 
Before anything had a soul, 
While life was a heave of Matter,  half inanimate, 
This little bit chipped off in brilliance
And went whizzing through the slow,  vast,  succulent stems. 
 
I believe there were no flowers,  then, 
In the world where the humming-bird flashed ahead of creation. 
I believe he pierced the slow vegetable veins with his long beak. 
 
Probably he was big
As mosses,  and little lizards,  they say were once big. 
Probably he was a jabbing,  terrifying monster. 
We look at him through the wrong end of the long telescope of Time, 
Luckily for us. "
13,CXXX,William Shakespeare,"My mistress’ eyes are nothing like the sun;
Coral is far more red,  than her lips red: 
If snow be white,  why then her breasts are dun;
If hairs be wires,  black wires grow on her head. 
I have seen roses damasked,  red and white, 
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
And in some perfumes is there more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. 
I love to hear her speak,  yet well I know
That music hath a far more pleasing sound: 
I grant I never saw a goddess go, 
My mistress,  when she walks,  treads on the ground: 
And yet by heaven,  I think my love as rare, 
As any she belied with false compare. "
14,"Bird,  came down the Walk",Emily Dickinson,"A Bird,  came down the Walk - 
He did not know I saw -
He bit an Angle Worm in halves
And ate the fellow,  raw,  
 
And then,  he drank a Dew
From a convenient Grass -
And then hopped sidewise to the Wall
To let a Beetle pass -
 
He glanced with rapid eyes, 
That hurried all abroad -
They looked like frightened Beads,  I thought, 
He stirred his Velvet Head.  - 
 
Like one in danger,  Cautious, 
I offered him a Crumb, 
And he unrolled his feathers,  
And rowed him softer Home -
 
Than Oars divide the Ocean, 
Too silver for a seam, 
Or Butterflies,  off Banks of Noon, 
Leap,  plashless as they swim. "
15,The City in the Sea,Edgar Allan Poe,"Lo! Death has reared himself a throne
In a strange city lying alone
Far down within the dim West, 
Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best
Have gone to their eternal rest. 
There shrines and palaces and towers
(Time-eaten towers that tremble not!)
Resemble nothing that is ours. 
Around,  by lifting winds forgot, 
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie. 
No rays from the holy heaven come down
On the long night-time of that town;
But light from out the lurid sea
Streams up the turrets silently-
Gleams up the pinnacles far and free-
Up domes- up spires- up kingly halls-
Up fanes- up Babylon-like walls-
Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers
Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers-
Up many and many a marvellous shrine
Whose wreathed friezes intertwine
The viol,  the violet,  and the vine. 
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie. 
So blend the turrets and shadows there
That all seem pendulous in air, 
While from a proud tower in the town
Death looks gigantically down. 

There open fanes and gaping graves
Yawn level with the luminous waves;
But not the riches there that lie
In each idols diamond eye-
Not the gaily-jewelled dead
Tempt the waters from their bed;
For no ripples curl,  alas!
Along that wilderness of glass-
No swellings tell that winds may be
Upon some far-off happier sea-
No heavings hint that winds have been
On seas less hideously serene. 

But lo,  a stir is in the air!
The wave- there is a movement there!
As if the towers had thrust aside, 
In slightly sinking,  the dull tide-
As if their tops had feebly given
A void within the filmy Heaven. 
The waves have now a redder glow-
The hours are breathing faint and low-
And when,  amid no earthly moans, 
Down,  down that town shall settle hence, 
Hell,  rising from a thousand thrones, 
Shall do it reverence. "
16,Coal,Audre Lorde,"Is the total black,  being spoken
From the earths inside. 
There are many kinds of open. 
How a diamond comes into a knot of flame   
How a sound comes into a word,  coloured   
By who pays what for speaking. 

Some words are open
Like a diamond on glass windows
Singing out within the crash of passing sun
Then there are words like stapled wagers
In a perforated book—buy and sign and tear apart—
And come whatever wills all chances
The stub remains
An ill-pulled tooth with a ragged edge. 
Some words live in my throat
Breeding like adders.  Others know sun
Seeking like gypsies over my tongue
To explode through my lips
Like young sparrows bursting from shell. 
Some words
Bedevil me. 

Love is a word another kind of open—
As a diamond comes into a knot of flame
I am black because I come from the earths inside   
Take my word for jewel in your open light. "
17,Blackberrying,Sylvia Plath,"Nobody in the lane,  and nothing,  nothing but blackberries,    
Blackberries on either side,  though on the right mainly, 
A blackberry alley,  going down in hooks,  and a sea
Somewhere at the end of it,  heaving.  Blackberries
Big as the ball of my thumb,  and dumb as eyes
Ebon in the hedges,  fat
With blue-red juices.  These they squander on my fingers. 
I had not asked for such a blood sisterhood; they must love me. 
They accommodate themselves to my milkbottle,  flattening their sides. 

Overhead go the choughs in black,  cacophonous flocks—
Bits of burnt paper wheeling in a blown sky. 
Theirs is the only voice,  protesting,  protesting. 
I do not think the sea will appear at all. 
The high,  green meadows are glowing,  as if lit from within. 
I come to one bush of berries so ripe it is a bush of flies, 
Hanging their bluegreen bellies and their wing panes in a Chinese screen. 
The honey-feast of the berries has stunned them; they believe in heaven.    
One more hook,  and the berries and bushes end. 

The only thing to come now is the sea. 
From between two hills a sudden wind funnels at me,    
Slapping its phantom laundry in my face. 
These hills are too green and sweet to have tasted salt. 
I follow the sheep path between them.  A last hook brings me   
To the hills’ northern face,  and the face is orange rock   
That looks out on nothing,  nothing but a great space   
Of white and pewter lights,  and a din like silversmiths   
Beating and beating at an intractable metal. "
18,A Death-Bed,Rudyard Kipling,"This is the State above the Law. 
    The State exists for the State alone. 
[This is a gland at the back of the jaw, 
    And an answering lump by the collar-bone. ]

Some die shouting in gas or fire;
    Some die silent,  by shell and shot. 
Some die desperate,  caught on the wire;
    Some die suddenly.  This will not. 

Regis suprema voluntas Lex
    [It will follow the regular course of—throats. ]
Some die pinned by the broken decks, 
    Some die sobbing between the boats. 

Some die eloquent,  pressed to death
    By the sliding trench as their friends can hear. 
Some die wholly in half a breath. 
    Some—give trouble for half a year. 

There is neither Evil nor Good in life. 
    Except as the needs of the State ordain. 
[Since it is rather too late for the knife, 
    All we can do is mask the pain. ]

Some die saintly in faith and hope—
    Some die thus in a prison-yard—
Some die broken by rape or the rope;
    Some die easily.  This dies hard. 

I will dash to pieces who bar my way. 
    Woe to the traitor!    Woe to the weak!
[Let him write what he wishes to say. 
    It tires him out if he tries to speak. ]

Some die quietly.     Some abound
    In loud self-pity.     Others spread
Bad morale through the cots around .  .  . 
    This is a type that is better dead. 

The war was forced on me by my foes. 
    All that I sought was the right to live. 
[Dont be afraid of a triple dose;
    The pain will neutralize half we give. 

Here are the needles.     See that he dies
    While the effects of the drug endure .  .  . 
What is the question he asks with his eyes?—
    Yes,  All-Highest,  to God,  be sure. ]"

20,An Age of Miracles,Joyce Carol Oates,"He walked to the window
stared down twenty stories to the street
gaseous and dizzy as a swamp
not visible at this height
but there had been a street down there
and he knew

It came with the apartment
and the guarded foyers and halls
and the doorman
holstered
beneath the uniform
the television split-screening
front and rear entrances

He knew it was all there
and he was here twenty stories above
the unsetteled swamp-mist
he knew the trucks bound for the bridge
were still passing near
he could feel them rumbling
in the soles of his feet
so he knew

the floor he walked on
was someones ceiling
and it was all normal tonight
and countable

river-
a five-by-three balcony through the door is
$200 deposit

the balcony door is stuck but
He can stare twenty stories down
from the windowsill
watching the swamp smokes curl and thin
and the swamp lapping at the base
and the unpaid-for miracle

21,Verses to Rhyme with “Rose”,Jane Austen,"Happy the lab’rer in his Sunday clothes!
In light-drab coat,  smart waistcoat,  well-darn’d hose, 
Andhat upon his head,  to church he goes;
As oft,  with conscious pride,  he downward throws
A glance upon the ample cabbage rose
That,  stuck in button-hole,  regales his nose, 
He envies not the gayest London beaux. 
In church he takes his seat among the rows, 
Pays to the place the reverence he owes, 
Likes best the prayers whose meaning least he knows, 
Lists to the sermon in a softening doze, 
And rouses joyous at the welcome close. "
